# Responsive Webpage Project

## Project Overview
This project is a responsive webpage built with React and Tailwind CSS, based on a Figma design. The layout adapts to mobile, tablet, and desktop devices, ensuring a seamless and pixel-perfect experience.

## Design Implementation Technique
To bring the required design to life and ensure seamless responsiveness across various platforms, I opted for an approach based on FlexBox design. I personally choosed FlexBox to implement my solution due to it's ability to reorder elements on screen which is great for building resposive layouts. Added to that the power of Tailwind CSS screen breakpoints to adapt to mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. This simple but yet performant approach permitted me to produce if I can say a nicely responsive component. 

## Tech Stack
- React
